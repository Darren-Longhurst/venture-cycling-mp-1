## UX

### User Stories

1. As a first time visitor, I want to quickly understand what the brand is about and whether entering a cycle event is something that interests me.

2. As a potential customer or past event entrant, I want to browse a gallery of past events, so that I can see what the experience is like or download a picture of myself as a momento.

3. As a first time or returning customer I want to quickly and easily locate and book an event to reserve my entry without needing to email or call.

4. As a potential customer, I'm looking to sign up to a newsletter to receive updates on upcoming events, event availability and offers.

5. As someone new to cycling, I'm looking to book my first event and curious to see what I would need to bring along with me for the ride.

6.  As a recreational rider I want to read testimonials from past entrants to hear about their experiences so I can feel confident about entering an event.

7. As a website user, I want to contact the company about any questions that I might have.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![colour-plette](README-files/mp1-colour-scheme.png)

* For the colour scheme I have used an image picker to draw some of the more prominent colours from the main Hero image on the site and from the company logo.
* The orange from the logo is used for all the buttons on the site with the dark brown colour on button hover. Text is kept white for good accesibility with both button colours. 
* The body of the site has a white background and dark brown text for better user accessibility.
* The Nav bar and footer are both be using cyan from the palette.
* The newsletter signup, uses dark brown background and white text.

## Typography

Typography chosen for the site is the same as used in the company logo - Open Sans, this is imported from Google Fonts. It is a widely used font, used on almost all browsers. If unavailable on the recipient browser however, the fall back font is Sans-Serif.

H1, H2, H3 Heading fonts will all use variations of Open Sans.

## Home Page

* On the landing page, users are drawn to the "Our Events" button, which scrolls the page to the events showcase area. 
* All buttons change from orange to dark brown on hover with the white text giving a good contrast in both colours.
* In the footer, all social media links will open on a new windown on selection
*
